SUMMARY:
placemat-tracker is a small project that I have created to help me with accounting for the sales of my Quin's Coins Coin Roll Hunting Placemats.
These placemats are sold via paypal which allows me to retrieve receipts from each and every purchase.
Once I retrieve these receipts, I can use this program to extract information from them to aide me with both packaging and accounting for each order.

This project has one file that does the majority of the work:
  - process_orders.py: a python script that extracts data from paypal receipts and outputs statistics used in packaging and accounting

In addition to this file, there are multiple directories that are used for various tasks such as tracking packages that had to be re-sent or finding cutoffs between different placemat runs.
  - These directories are left empty in the public project repository and populated locally.

Note: This program is not a stand-alone project. It works in conjunction with various spreadsheets that are stored locally to track the sales of the Quin's Coins Coin Roll Hunting Placemats.
